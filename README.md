This CAS is structured into six in-depth modules, each focused on building essential skills in data science, statistical analysis, machine learning, ethical practices, peer consulting, and deep learning. Each module is designed to provide practical knowledge, hands-on experience, and opportunities for immersive learning in unique settings.

## Module 1: Data Acquisition and Management
In this module, we explore:
- Various **data sources** and **data types**
- Fundamental techniques for designing **data management models**
- Developing effective **data management plans** to support robust data handling in data science
