# Module 5 Peer reviews - Maitane

### Question: Can you use these measurement stations to imrove the density?

Airpollution: Monitoring Air Quality of City

Fixed Measurement stations with high quality but expensive but gives low denisity of measurements
-> Cover more in space with lower accuracy

The cheaper measurements can contain contents of other substances in the air more than the stationary high quality ones


After 2 week the calibration experiences a big drift

Goal: Provide a calibration for these measurements.

Focus on the gasses.
The calibration in the lab is massively different than in the field where it can be all over the place

Every measurement run is for 30 hours in the data set that Maitane used from her **collegue**.

Focusses for only **2 gasses** for now (so you could certainly expand there)

### did the split for 1 of 3 day as a test set and first 2 as training set

### apply Random Forest (/ clustering with PCA/UMAP?)
did linear reg. and multivariate lin. reg with increasing complexity
